## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS/SCSS and its custom properties
- CSS custom properties and transitions
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Figma design file

### What I learned

I've learned how to make my workflow ready for bigger projects by separating SASS files for different parts of project (variables, mixins, styles for parts of website etc.) I know it wasn't optimal to do that in that small project, but I wanted to try something new.
